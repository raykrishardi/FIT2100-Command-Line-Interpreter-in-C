       shell prompts the user for commands and interprets the given command if
       the given command is one of the commands supported by the shell (clear,
       cd, ls, echo, create, copy, search, run, halt, help, and quit).
       The "help" command can be used to display this user manual which includes
       information on the shell's builtin commands and their corresponding syntax.
       Finally, in order to exit the shell, the user can use the "quit" command.

       clear
            Clear the output screen.

       cd <directory>
            Change the default directory to <directory>.
            If the argument <directory> is not present, the current directory
            is changed to the directory given by the HOME environment variable
            in Unix.

       ls <directory>
            List the contents of the given directory named <directory>.

       echo <statement>
            Display <statement> on the output screen with a newline character.
            Statement is a sequence of characters that begins and ends with
            a double quote (e.g. "statement").

       create <file>
            Create a new file with the name <file>.
            If there is an existing file with the same name <file> then the existing
            file will be overwritten by the newly created file.

       copy <old> <new>
            Copy the contents of an existing file named <old> to a new file named <new>.
            If there is an existing file with the same name <new> then the existing
            file will be overwritten by the newly created file.

       search <pattern> <file>
            Display the number of occurrences of a sequence of characters <pattern>
            in the file named <file>.

       run <program>[&]
            Execute an executable program named <program> in foreground.
            If the '&' symbol is included at the end of <program> (e.g. program&),
            the executable program named <program> will run in background.

       halt <program>
            Stop executing the program named <program>.

       help
            Display this user manual using the command less in Unix.

       quit
            Terminate the CLI program and exit.
