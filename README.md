# Command-Line Interpreter (shell) in C

# About the project:
This project is my first assignment for the FIT2100 (Operating Systems) unit. This project contains the following: 
- shell.c, shell.h, and main.c
  - C implementation of basic *nix shell that prompts the user for commands and interprets the given command if the given command is one of the commands supported by the shell (clear, cd, ls, echo, create, copy, search, run, halt, help, and quit).
- makefile for building the C program
- User documentation for the C program
